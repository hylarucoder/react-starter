# React Starter

A very opinionated and uncompromising boilerplate for react start for desktop development

## Feature

1. All Feature Supported By The Great Tool -- **Vite** ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
2. Type Hint - Typescript for better multi-user developing experience
3. style management - tailwind for startup and then css-modules for dedicatedly styling components
4. store management - mobx-react
5. components management - mostly functional components plus react hooks
6. auto lint && format by eslint && prettier && husky

## Inspired by, But **Much More Opinionated**
