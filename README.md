# React Starter

A very opinionated and uncompromising boilerplate for react start

## Feature

1. React Script - (style-loader/hot-reload/code-splitting/assets-management)
2. Type Hint  - Typescript for better multi-user develop experience
3. style management - tailwind and styled-components
4. store management - redux-toolkit/redux/redux
5. components management - mostly functional components plus react hooks
