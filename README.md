# React Starter

A very opinionated and uncompromising boilerplate for react start

## Feature

1. All Feature Supported By React Script - (style-loader/hot-reload/code-splitting/assets-management)
2. Type Hint  - Typescript for better multi-user developing experience
3. style management - tailwind for startup and then styled-components for dedicatedly styling components
4. store management - redux-toolkit/redux/redux
5. components management - mostly functional components plus react hooks
6. auto lint && format by eslint && prettier && husky

## Inspired by, But **Much More Opinionated**
